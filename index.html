            At the end of the Cold War, the town of Borne Sulinowo suddenly appeared on the map in northwestern Poland.

            One of the most secretive and important Soviet military bases in the Eastern bloc, it was outside of Polish control during the Cold War. Officially, it did not exist. First established by the Nazis, then taken over by the Soviets and rumoured to have hidden nuclear warheads, now Borne Sulinowo is home to over 5,000 people.

            His statement, in a pre-trial hearing this week about phone hacking, is a remarkably frank self-portrait that veers from being angry, outraged and obsessive to often apparently being in a state of flight or fight.

            Prince Harry believed his battles with the tabloid press put him at risk from a public that had been turned against him, depicting him, in his own words, as a "thicko", "cheat", "underage drinker" and "irresponsible drug taker".
            
            We also learned that this isn't going to go away - with Prince Harry ready to break the taboo about a royal in the witness box, by making it clear that he will give evidence in person in court, if not in this case then with others being brought against other newspaper groups.

            There is a political undertone that might have got lost in the royal soap opera. Harry accuses the press barons of creating a "stalemate society, where they can enrage the public over the most mundane and petty things, to distract from the critical issues for our country and communities".

This hacking case, where he claims stories were based on illegally obtained information, hits all of Harry's buttons. The claims are linked to his loss of his mother, his sense of grievance towards his brother, his outrage at press behaviour, fears for his family's safety and his palpable sense of disappointment in his father for wanting to keep the tabloids "onside".

Prince Harry is no stranger to dropping royal bombshells, but this court case against News Group Newspapers, which hasn't even reached a trial yet, has already produced an extraordinary barrage of claims and revelations.

Much of this was about the serpentine relationship between the Royal Family and the press.

            The welcome in Wrexham is often colourful, and sometimes a little unorthodox, but the conversation never takes long to land upon football – especially these days.

Just two days earlier, Wrexham AFC, one of the oldest professional football teams in the world, had fought back from a 1-0 deficit to secure promotion into the English Football League following a 15-year exile in one of the UK's lowest and least glamorous football divisions. As the final whistle sounded, thousands of supporters stormed the pitch; its two Hollywood owners, Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney, burst into tears; and fans partied late into the night in scenes not seen here for decades.
